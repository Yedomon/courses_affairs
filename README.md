Proposal 


## Genetic improvement of Maize (Zea mays L.) for Drought and low Nitrogen Tolerance 



Background:

Maize (Zea mays L.) originated from Central America where it is widely cultivated as a staple food crop. It is the third worldwide cultivated crop after rice and wheat (Farfan et al., 2015). It is an Important crop used to provide food, feed, fodder, fuel, starch, oils, protein and alcohol (Ram Reddy & Jabeen, 2016). In Africa, the crop is mostly grown in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), feeding more than 300 million people ( Beyene et al., 2016; Bankole et al., 2017). The area under cultivation is over 38 million ha and its production is estimated to be about 73 million tons (FAOSTAT, 2019). Asia produces 33%  while Africa produces only 7% and its production is still low compare to the others countries (FAOSTAT, 2019). Darfour & Rosentrater (2016) reported that maize accounts for about 50% of total cereal production in Ghana. 


Despite its importance, maize productivity and yield in many production zones in Ghana continues to be low with a national average of 1.7tons/ha (MoFA 2011). This is attributed to biotic and abiotic constraints including low soil nutrients, especially nitrogen, erratic rainfall distribution, pests and diseases among others (Laux et al. 2009; MacCarthy et al., 2015). These constraints significantly reduce the development of maize during the grain filling stage in arid, semi-arid and temperate regions (Weber et al., 2012). 
In Senegal, maize is the 3 most important cereal crop after rice and millet with a production estimated at 264342 T in 2017 (FAOSTAT, 2019). It is mostly use for food and feed production. 

Senegalese government initiated maize program in 2003 in all the country but it was not successful. The intention to meet the gap of demand was not reached.  In 2009 despite the realising of  nine new varieties, the production was not sufficient and the government imported (US$2 million) maize in the country to meet the food and feed needs (Aperçu de l’agriculture sénégalaise- Au Sénégal, le cœur du Sénégal. 2019 ww.au-senegal.com › l-agriculture-senegalaise, 359). Even though the average production of these varieties is reducing year by year.  


However, national maize production in Senegal faces several biotic ( Striga, diseases, pests) and abiotic (land degradation ,heat, salinity) constraints including drought and low soil fertility (D’Alessandro et al., 2015). In addition, 95% of maize cultivated land are not irrigated. Senegalese maize production depends on the rainfall (CSA, 2016). However, the national maize production evolves into scallop teeth during these last ten years. This variation is mainly due to late or erratic rainfall coupled with soil degradation that reduces its fertility (D’Alessandro et al., 2015). As a result, maize production in Senegal has decreased by 17% between 2016 and 2017 (FAOSTAT, 2019). Drought and low soils fertility are part of the factors that cause food insecurity in Senegal. The same author shows that maize production may continue to decrease by 5-25% in the locality where are grown.
