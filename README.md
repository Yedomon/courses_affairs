Proposal 


## Genetic improvement of Maize (Zea mays L.) for Drought and low Nitrogen Tolerance 



Background:

Maize (Zea mays L.) is originated from Central America where it is widely cultivated as a staple food crop. It is the third worldwide cultivated crop after rice and wheat (Farfan et al., 2015). It is an Important crop used to provide food, feed, fodder, fuel, starch, oils, protein and alcohol (Ram Reddy & Jabeen, 2016). In Africa, the crop is mostly grown in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), feeding more than 300 million people ( Beyene et al., 2016; Bankole et al., 2017). The area under cultivation is over 38 million ha and its production is estimated to be about 73 million tons (FAOSTAT, 2019). Asia produces 33%  while Africa produces only 7% and its production is still low compare to the others countries (FAOSTAT, 2019). Darfour & Rosentrater (2016) reported that maize accounts for about 50% of total cereal production in Ghana for example. 

Despite its importance, maize productivity and yield continues to be low due to biotic and abiotic constraints including low soil nutrients, especially nitrogen, erratic rainfall distribution, pests and diseases among others (Laux et al. 2009; MacCarthy et al., 2015). These constraints significantly reduce the development of maize during the grain filling stage in arid, semi-arid and temperate regions (Weber et al., 2012). 


SSA maize production faces to so many challenges that cause its low yield. One of the biggest challenges to its production is drought. Due to climate change, this drought may increase considerably (Farfan et al., 2015). Drought is one of the most important abiotic stresses globally which seriously hampers the productivity of agricultural crops causing yield lost up to 50% (Badu-Apraku et al., 2004; Liang et al., 2011; Sabagh et al., 2015; Bankole et al., 2017; Badu-Apraku et al., 2018). Almost 40% of African’s area is affected by the drought with 10-25% yield reduction (Fisher et al., 2015). Drought is one of the most climate related change that affect food production (Rice, maize, sorghum) in Senegal (Breuer, 2012).

Drought can occur at any production stage of maize but, the most susceptible stage is the interval anther-silking. When it happens at this stage, it causes anther abortion and reduces considerably the yield ( Maazou et al., 2016). Water availability is the main element for physiological processes that determine plant productivity (Moyano, et al., 2013). Silva et al. (2011) claim that due to climate change, more serious and longer effects of drought should be expected in any area of the world.  As a result, food insecurity can occur.


Plant growth and survival depend strongly on water availability (Bashir et al., 2019). Drought increases the yield loss in the plant growth stage and affects the quality and the quantity of the production (Waseem et al., 2011; Kamali, et al., 2018; Bashir et al., 2019). 





When the plant is subject to drought stress, it uses different mechanisms for its survival. Some mechanisms such are drought avoidance, drought escape and drought tolerance are mainly involved in drought stress. 


The drought avoidance is the ability to the plant to finish its development before severe stress occurs. 



The escape mechanism is define as the ability of the plant to reserve the water into its cells and will use it to achieve the cycle of development. 



Drought tolerance is define as an aptitude to the plant to develop with acceptable yield even if its expose to drought stress. 





The most affected aspect in plant growth under drought condition is the process of photosynthesis. When the plant is expose to drought, the stomata are close to reduce evapotranspiration. The closure of the stomata decrease the absorption of the CO2, this directly affects the photochemical activity of photosystem II (PSII) and the electrons exchanges (Efeoǧlu et al., 2009). 





This results in the synthesize of antioxidant enzyme which helps to defend against the effect of oxidative stress that affects the plant growth and consequently the yield (Harb et al., 2010; Waseem et al., 2011). Breeding crops for drought tolerance is, therefore, an urgent need to ensure food security. It is a key adaptive strategy particularly for smallholder farmers with limited access to irrigation (Aslam et al., 2015). 







Drought-tolerant maize hybrids and open-pollinated varieties (OPVs) have been developed and are being cultivated in many African countries. Edmeades et al. (1989) reported that drought management has been done since 1970s at CIMMYT. Several managements have been done by the breeders to improve maize production under drought conditions ( Maazouet al., 2016). In Senegal for example, farmers are still using OPV because of the lack of hybrids with high yielding. This is increasingly important as the last few years have experienced shorter and increasingly erratic rainy seasons making it necessary to develop varieties that are drought tolerant in order to ensure food security (Aslam et al., 2015).





In addition to the efforts that have been made to reduce yield loses dues to drought, low soil fertility specially low nitrogen is reported as the second major constraints of maize and pearl millet production with more than 50% yield reduction in maize (Gemenet et al, 2010; Badu-Apraku et al., 2018; Buchaillot et al., 2019; Das et al., 2019).





Most often, the cropping system practised by Smallholder farmers deplete the soil nutrients with no proper course to restore the fertility of the soil through management practices thus the poor soil state of most farm land in SSA. 




In situation where soil fertility improvement is done, they are usually for the short term, mostly by the use of inorganic fertilisers (Das et al., 2019). These fertilisers in the long term do not improve the soil structures and its fertility since they mostly get leached or run-off resulting in soil degradation and environmental pollution (Raimiet et al., 2017). 







When the crop is expose to low soil fertility, especially low nitrogen, its development is stunting and the leaf turn to chlorosis resulting in significant reduction in grain yield. Grain development in cereals requires 70 to 80% of nitrogen during vegetative growth before the flowering stage (Demotes-Mainard and Jeuffroy, 2001). 


Nitrogen-based fertilizers have previously been used to enhance grain yield and are considered to be the best fertilizers for maize production (Andrews and Lea, 2013). 


Most soils in SSA are poor in terms of fertility, thus resulting in low yields for resource constraint farmers who are unable to purchase fertilizers due to its high cost (Ertiro et al., 2017). With a standard of 87kg nitrogen use per hectare and per year by developing countries, Africans farmers are using only 9kg / ha/ year (Kiboi et al., 2019). 



Programs like CIMMYT have started to breed maize for drought tolerance since 1970s and many improved lines for low nitrogen tolerance have been develop. Despite the efforts that CIMMYT has been made, the maize production is still limited by the lack of nitrogen (Bänziger et al., 2006). 


Despite the efforts and significant discoveries in maize breeding for drought and low nitrogen tolerance, the crop yield is still affected by these two constraints. Developing new inbred lines that contribute both drought and low nitrogen tolerance in hybrid combinations will increase farmers’ yields, increase their incomes and improve their livelihoods. Developing new tolerant hybrids to low soil nitrogen in maize is critical in SSA where fertilizers are not always available to farmers. 

It is also important for reducing environmental pollution due to inorganic fertilizers. In other ways, the current world population of 7.6 billion is expected to reach 9.8 billion in 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100, according to a new United Nations report (UN, 2017). This increasing population trend also means increasing demand for food and agricultural products. Niu, et al. (2019) reported that this food demand is expected to be 40% and the water requirement will increase up to 50%. However, achieving a sustainable and secure supply of agricultural products for food and nutritional security is a complex problem requiring a multi-faceted solution, including drought and low nitrogen improvements in a crop. 
Facing all these challenges, we decided to make available to the farmers a high performant material that could be used in the long-term breeding program. 

The conventional development of maize inbred lines requires 6 to 10 generations to get pure lines or to incorporate quantitatively inherited traits that are needed in the news lines ( Murovec & Bohanec, 2012; Vanous et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2017; Zararsiz et al., 2019). 

However, an alternative technique that is the double haploid (DH) have been introduced and used to develop lines for stress tolerance by CIMMYT, NARS and other programs 11 years ago. 



This DH method requires only two generations to develop homozygous inbred lines that are more amenable to marker-assisted selection (Wu et al., 2017). Marker-assisted selection (MAS) offers an option to expedite the development of varieties that are tolerant to drought and low nitrogen stress (Murovec & Bohanec, 2012; Sserumaga et al., 2016; Vanous et al., 2017). DH can be used to enhance the development of maize germplasm by pyramiding desired alleles in a short time compared to conventional breeding. It reduces the labour force, the cost and the time consuming of the breeding program. 



The DH technique is more efficient than the conventional breeding in term of the uniformity, the vigor and the stability of the lines (Murovec & Bohanec, 2012; Sserumaga et al., 2016). 



Two DH techniques can be used in maize breeding: in vitro and in vivo. The in vivo DH is the most widely used because it has been shown that it is more accurate than the in vitro technology (Chaikam, et al., 2019). 




The in vitro DH has many limitations with high laboratory equipment required. Maternal and paternal haploid are both involved in the in vivo DH (Zararsiz et al., 2019). In paternal DH, the inducer is used as a female and the donor as the male parent from which the chromosome comes from. The cytoplasm is only coming from the inducer. The DH technique first starts by creating haploid that have only the female gamete. This is done by using inducer to eliminate the male character in the chromosome. This method is referred to the maternal haploid and the cytoplasm and the chromosome both come from the donor parent (Zararsiz et al., 2019). The DH lines are obtain by the doubling of this gamete using a chemicals that is for the most of the cases Colchicine (Sserumaga et al., 2016; Molenaar et al., 2019). Spontaneous chromosome doubling gives a low rate of inbred, that explains the reason why breeders prefer the use of Colchicine rather than spontaneous chromosome doubling (Wu et al., 2017). 



The GCA is mainly used to select better parents based on progeny performances while SCA is most commonly used to select for hybrid vigor in specific hybrid combinations. This selection is usually done in F1. It can also be used in F2 and others generations (Singh et al., 2019). 
Plants have several strategies to overcome drought and low nitrogen stresses. This involves the genes contained in each plant and the role that they have in this special trait (Bashir et al., 2019). However, drought is a complex quantitative trait controlled by many loci with small effects and the study of its inheritance is complicated (X. Zhang et al., 2016). Because of the complexity of the stress tolerant traits, the conventional breeding had challenges to identify them with accuracy (Y.N. Xiao et al., 2005). Identifying the genetic component underlining the traits of interest is key in addressing stress tolerance. In addition to that, low nitrogen is also controlled by several genes (Y. Zhang et al., 2015). To study the components conferring its tolerances, molecular works are indispensable. Contrary to molecular breeding, conventional breeding only help to select good performing lines based on visual observations but it cannot show the multi-genic traits in that line (Wang & Qin, 2017). One of the most powerful tool to effectively and efficiently identify genome-phenotype associations is genome wide association study (GWAS) (Zhang et al., 2016; Turuspekov et al., 2017). GWAS helps to identify a multitude of underlying drought tolerance genes and their functions (Korte & Farlow, 2013; Wang & Qin, 2017; Zhu et al., 2018). Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) has been reported as a powerful technology to perform GWAS especially for new germplasms (Elshire et al., 2011). The GBS has an advantage in the case that it can predetermine genetic variation across all sample, the cost by sample may be low for a certain applications. In addition to the SNP detection the GBS can identify others variation like mutations. It can do comparative analysis without a reference genome (Chung, et al., 2017).To answer these questions and the hypothesis, we set as general objective to contribute to the development of maize hybrids that can grow under drought and low nitrogen conditions with high yields that will be accepted by farmers.
Fours specific Objectives come out for this study:
	To develop maize inbred lines for drought and low nitrogen tolerance through double haploid technology.
	To classify inbred lines from a population into heterotic groups.
	To identify candidate genes associated with these two constraints through a genome-wide association study.
	To estimate combining ability and the mode of inheritance for drought and low nitrogen tolerance of identified inbred lines.
